### Final-Project-GA: Usage Insights 

##User Stories
- The logged users will be able to add data from consumer usage, and edit/delete the data, into the public page. This is through the React frontend, communicating to the backend CRUD Java Spring/Boot backend.
- The data will add a total to the usage statistics at the top. This will be used in a single page React application. 
- Low Usage will be denoted by red markers, high usage by green markers, as entries. 

MVP:
